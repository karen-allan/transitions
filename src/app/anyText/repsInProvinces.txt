        Every province has different forms to help you achieve designating the advocates you want to have represent you. In <b><a
        target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/cssd/files/seniors-pdf-ahcd-booklet.pdf">Newfoundland and Labrador</a></b> the form is
        called the Advance Health Care Directive form and within this form there is a section where you can designate your Advocate who
        instead of being called your Representative as in B.C., they are called your Substitute Decision Maker. Note the difference
        between this and the Temporary Substitute Decision Maker. It could all be so much easier if it was the same across the country!
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://novascotia.ca/just/pda/_docs/PersonalDirectiveLongForm0311.pdf">Nova Scotia</a></b>
        your Advocates are called Delegates and the Advanced Care form is called your Personal Directive. If you don't choose a Delegate,
        then the care provider will be authorized under the Personal Directives Act to use the called statutory decision-makers form. As
        with the Temporary Substitute Decision Makers form in B.C. this form will allow a health care provider to start at the top of the
        list and continue down it until they find someone who agrees to be your Delegate.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/health_care_directive_form.pdf">
        Prince Edward Island</a></b> the Health Advocate is called the Proxy and the Advanced Care Form you fill out is called a Health
        Care Directive. Unlike B.C., a Proxy need only be over 16, whereas in B.C. the 'Representative' must be over 19.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca/en/uploads/file/pdfs/Advance_Health_Care_Directives_Form_EN.pdf">
        New Brunswick</a></b> the Health Advocate is also called the Proxy and the form is also called the Health Care Directive. It also
        has a section where you can add those who you wish to have contacted. Only one witness is needed.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/issue-directives-case-incapacity">Quebec</a></b>
        the Advocate is called the Mandatary and the form is called the Advance Medical Directives. They will not allow you to view this
        form until you create a 'clicSÃ‰QUR' account, after which a personalized form will be created for you.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://jss.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DWDC__2020Form_Ontario.pdf">Ontario</a></b> your
        Advocate is called the Substitute Decision Maker and the Advanced Care form is called the Advance Care Directive/Wishes form. It
        carries no legal weight, however, so anything that you have written down on this form in terms of your wishes may be disregarded
        by both your Substitute Decision Maker and by the medical team who will make decisions based on the situation at the current
        moment in time.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/documents/health_care_directive.pdf">Manitoba</a></b> your Advocate
        is called your Proxy and the form that you fill out is called the Heath Care Directive. There is no need to have anyone act as
        Witnesses with this simple to use form. They do not have any authority involving Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID).
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/sites/default/files/2021-05/Form-2021-02-26-AdvancedCarePlanningAppointingaProxy-v01_0.pdf">
        Saskatchewan</a></b> your Advocate is also called a Proxy and the form is called an Advance Directive. If you have not designated
        a Proxy, then the health care provider will appoint one based on the Temporary Substitute Decision Maker list.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://formsmgmt.gov.ab.ca/Public/OPG5521.xdp">Alberta</a></b> your Advocate is also called an
        Agent and the form is called an Personal Directive. This form provides for a wider range of duties that can be performed by the
        Agent as compared to other forms.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/dwdcanada/pages/3905/attachments/original/1631639150/DWDC__2021Form_NorthwestTerritories_Fillable_092021.pdf?1631639150">
        the North West Territories (NWT)</a></b> your Advocate is called the Agent and the Advanced Care form is called the Personal
        Directive. It also includes areas to specifically request and/or reject certain emergency or life prolonging health care procedures.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank"
                 href="https://yukon.ca/sites/yukon.ca/files/hss/hss-forms/hss-careconsent-abbreviated-advance-directive.pdf"> the Yukon</a></b>
        the Advocate is called the Proxy and the Advance Care form is called the Representative Agreement. This form also leaves room for
        you to add special directives related to your future care in terms of emergency or life prolonging procedures.
        <br><br>
        In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://yukon.ca/sites/yukon.ca/files/hss/hss-forms/hss-careconsent-abbreviated-advance-directive.pdf">Nunavut</a></b>
        legally there is no such thing as a stated Advocate and Advance Care Directives are not recognized. Anyone wishing to act as your
        Guardian must be willing to apply to the Nunavut Court of Justice for an order appointing them.
