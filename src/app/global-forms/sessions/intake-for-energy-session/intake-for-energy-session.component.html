                    I understand that the Eden Energy Medicine sessions I receive are provided for the basic purpose of harmonizing
                    my body's energies. It can bring about physical improvements by impacting the electromagnetic and your more subtle
                    energy fields.
                    <br><br>
                    But I further understand that Eden Energy Medicine should not be construed as a substitute for
                    needed medical attention and that practitioners do not diagnose, treat or prescribe for medical conditions.

                    I understand that I must have proof of up-to-date Covid vaccinations in order to meet with you in person.
                    If I have not been vaccinated I can still see you via a remote call, for example a Zoom or phone meeting.
                    <br><br>
                    I agree to provide 24 hours notice if I want to cancel an appointment. As well, I agree to bring proof of
                    my Covid vaccination in the form of the vaccine passport. By signing below I agree and accept the above conditions.
