                    I understand that the End of Life Doula Consultations I receive are provided for the basic purpose of preparing
                    myself and my family for my eventual end of life care and legacy. I know that an End of Life Doula can help
                    with end of life financial and health related questions, concerns and that I can learn how to better plan,
                    prepare and document all of my wishes and hopes for a good ending.
                    <br><br>
                    But I further understand that End of Life Doulas are not a substitute for medical palliative care, hospice care
                    or emergency care but are rather meant to fill the wholes where standard medical care can not. I also understand
                    that doulas can never initiate conversations related to MAID, but if asked can clarify the latest rules as best
                    as possible. For further information about the new MAID laws contact Death With Dignity.
                    <br><br>
                    I also know that End of Life Doulas can do much to aid in the comfort and care of a dying person but they
                    can not prescribe or give out medications of any kind.
                    <br><br>
                    I understand that I must have proof of up-to-date Covid vaccinations in order to meet with you in person.
                    If I have not been vaccinated I can still see you via a remote call, for example a Zoom or phone meeting.
                    <br><br>
                    I agree to provide 24 hours notice if I want to cancel an appointment. As well, I agree to bring proof of
                    my Covid vaccination in the form of the vaccine passport. By signing below I agree and accept the above conditions.
