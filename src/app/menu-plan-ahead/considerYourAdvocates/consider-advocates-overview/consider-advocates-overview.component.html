        Let's say you are in an accident or suffer a critical illness and end up in Emergency and are incapable of
        answering for yourself. When you arrive at the hospital - a health care team member is legally required to search for your
        next-of-kin in order to find an advocate for you. They must then follow the directives set by law called many
        different names
        depending on the province you are in,
        but
        in general looks something like the one that B.C. uses called the Temporary Substitute Decision Maker List (TSDM).
        <br><br>
        All adults are encouraged to put a basic health care plan together in case of an accident or emergency. This plan should
        include who you would like to make decisions for you should you be incapacitated in some way. Generally if you are young
        and healthy you will want them to agree to any and all life saving treatments.
        <br><br>
        This is something most of us never think of. But in most provinces in Canada, if you haven't got any kind of document
        written that designates your primary and/or secondary Advocate, this choice for who will be contacted on your behalf will
        be made by a health care professional you have likely never met.
        <br><br>
        The health care provider will start at the top of this form contacting a next of kin. If the first person on that list is not
        qualified or available to advocate for you, they will then move down the list. The hierarchy of contacts set out on this form is:

        If you have no issues with the idea that your health and life decisions are about to be made by a family member or friend
        selected by a health care professional you have never met, then this might work for you. If, however you know that
        you want your oldest
        grand-child who is legally eligible to be the decision maker for you, but you have not written this wish down, it is
        highly unlikely that they will work their way down the list to that level. Maybe instead, they will choose your spouse,
        the top person on the list to call. This could be a soon-to-be-ex-spouse who may not have your best interests at heart.
        Your new significant other, who is your true lover, may not even show up on the list.
        <br><br>
        It is for this reason, that it is smart and proactive to designate your own preferred Health Care Advocate who will, in most
        regions of Canada, be able to make those life and death decisions on your behalf. By simply stating your Advocate, you
        can quickly and easily select the one or, at maximum two people you trust who would best handle any health related
        decisions if you are not in a position to do so due to accident or injury. You are letting the health care team know who
        you have specifically chosen to make decisions for you related to your situation.
    </p>

<div class = "content-dark-copy pad-top">
    <p>
        Instead of leaving your health decisions up to B.C. Law, you can set who YOU want as your Substitute Decision Maker (SDM). Again,
        this is only if you are incapable of making your own decisions due to injury or illness. You can name your preferred SDM and even
        an alternate SDM by filling out a form called Representative Section-9. (This applies to B.C. only, check your province or state for
        a form that provides the same service).
        <br><br>
        Your Temporary Substitute Decision Maker must follow the directives you have laid out in this Enhanced Representation Agreement
        should you become incapacitated. If you are only partially ‘incapable’ you can still make some decisions and these will be given
        priority. There is no need to involve a Lawyer, Doctor or Notary Public as Representative 9 is legal as long as proper witnesses and
        signatures are made.
        <br><br>
        Personal decisions include where you live (examples are a hospital, home care, hospice etc.), your diet, clothing and hygiene and
        activities. It also includes decisions about who can have contact with you.
        <br><br>
        Health care decisions include tests, examinations, treatments and procedures related to your health such as surgery, medication
        and vaccines. It also gives permission for the Representative to make decisions about life support and life prolonging procedures.
        It does NOT include decisions related to financial or legal decisions. If you are still of sound mind, you will always be the
        first to make your own decisions. However, if not, the health care provider will adhere to your fully legal Section-9
        Representative document.

        Ask your Representatives first and make sure they are willing to take on the task. Your witnesses do not need to be present
        during the signing with the Representatives, but they do need to see you sign the form.
        <br><br>
        We at Transitions In Energy have created a wizard for you that will hopefully give you instructions that make sense for humans.
        Follow the wizard and answer all relevant details. Once completed the wizard produces a form that fulfills all the legal
        guidelines.
        Next just print and have everyone witness and sign!

            This first section of the Rep 9 form states that this particular document is one of many replications available on the
            Internet. It reiterates that this form doesn't constitute legal advice, may not be suitable for everyone and can and may be
            updated at any time.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 1</b> is where you fill in your full legal name, full address and the current date. Make sure you fill these in as they are
            shown on other legal documents such as your drivers license or tax forms.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 2</b> relates to any previous Representative Section-9 from you may have written. If this is your first Representative
            Section-9 agreement, you can disregard this line. If it isn't you need to follow the instructions at the bottom of the page to
            revoke your original Representative.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 3</b> is where you fill in the full legal name and full legal address of your primary Substitute Decision Maker, also known
            simply as 'Representative'.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-dark-copy pad-top-2">
        <p>
            <b>SECTION 4</b> is where you fill in the full legal name and full address of your Alternate Substitute Decision Maker, also known
            simply as your 'Alternate Representative'. You can choose an Alternate Representative to ensure that you are still protected if
            your first Representative either dies or resigns him or herself from the position or becomes 'incapable'. It is also to protect
            yourself should you divorce or separate from your Primary Representative.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 5</b> is not relevant to you if you have NOT appointed an Alternate Representative. If you have no Alternate Representative,
            cross (X) this line out. If you have appointed an Alternate and you wish to substitute them for the Primary Representative you need to
            fill out the STATUTORY DECLARATON FOR EVIDENCE OF AUTHORITY OF ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE found at the bottom of the document.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 6</b> states that you give permission for your Representative(s) to present and support your health care wishes to the medical
            community.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 7</b> allows you to write down specific wishes and requests related to your health care. For example if you are suffering
            from a disease with no cure, you may want to write down your NO CPR directive. If you also fill out an Advanced Care Plan, you are
            prompted to answer your wishes related to many of the common situations.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 8</b> simply states that the agreement becomes valid as of the date signed by you, your Representative(s) and your Witnesses.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 9 - ADULT'S SIGNATURE:</b> is where you sign the form, print your name and write the date in front of your Witnesses.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 9 - WITNESSES TO ADULT'S SIGNATURE:</b> is where the Witnesses sign, printing out their full name and full legal
            address. If one of your witnesses is a Lawyer or
            Notary Public, you only need one witness. If not, you need two Witnesses. They must witness you sign the form here.
            <br><br>
            Check below to make sure the witnesses you have chosen meet the criteria set out by law. You will need to obtain two witnesses
            unless you employ a lawyer or Notary Public in which case only 1 signature is needed. The witnesses must be on hand to watch you
            sign before they sign.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECTION 9 - REPRESENTATIVES SIGNATURES:</b> is where you and your primary and secondary, if
            applicable, Representative(s) sign the
            form. They do not have to sign this portion in front of Witnesses.
            <br><br>
            This document should be kept with your will, and a copy should be given to the Representative you choose, the alternate if you choose,
            to have one. You can also leave a copy with your family doctor. Let your family, specifically your Representatives know where you have
            placed all your important documents. I personally have all of my documents, including the financial information in a fire-proof safe.
            Paramedics know to look for any kind of directive on or in your fridge.
