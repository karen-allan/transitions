    <div class="dark-copy">
        There is an obvious lack of ancient wisdom in all of this. Not that long ago it was very common for folks
        to go to their local <q>healer</q> whenever they or a family member were ill or in some kind of distress. If they
        were having a baby the midwife and/or the women of the village helped the mother give birth. If a person was
        sick they often had a wise elder, a herbalist or a doctor who did house calls. And in death, the family was there
        by their side, helping them transition.
        <br><br>
        How do we get back to taking responsibility for our own health? We have separated our bodies into parts and we have
        specialists who work on these parts and they send us for test after test. They may confer with one another but the
        doctor who is supposed to provide the big picture, the general practitioner, is often not equipped to put it all together - because it has been
        very effectively taken apart!

        <h2>Let's get holistic again</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        For many, the Holistic approach is considered the 'crazy' approach. Treating the body as an inter-communicating work of
        art that actually does know of each of it's parts is now deemed 'new age' and therefore unreliable.

        When you drill down, however you find beyond the mass, there is energy. It is what you are made of, period.
        Just as the blood in our body is continuously flowing for our lifetimes, energy is also at work throughout our
        lives. It is an intelligent, responsive system like every other system in the body that maintains balance. And
        it can be moved, re-directed, decreased and increased ... using non-invasive, safe and effective techniques!

    <span><b><i>Energy Tip</i></b> :
        The concept of energy in your body is so foreign to most but it is actually right there all the time
        for you to play with.
        Start by looking at a white wall and then gaze gently at your fingertips.
        Eventually you may see a small outline around each finger, this is the inner Etheric layer of
        your Aura which could be white or any other color. It is the layer where all changes exist first before becoming
        manifested into matter.

        <h2>How do we die better?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        We can manage many of our health issues by working with our own energy system. This puts you back in charge of
        your life. What is equally important is to also be in charge of your own dying. The fact is 100% of us will die.
        But, as with our health, we would rather not think about it. But this new world is bringing up changes in
        how we view just about everything.
        <br><br>
        Sexual orientation definitions are changing. Respect for our Indigenous cultures is increasing. Equality for
        people of color is making huge strides. The prejudice around aging is also being challenged. The way we
        choose to die is changing as well.

        <h2>Let's keep our integrity</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        Did you know that most funeral homes are owned by mega-corporations? Or
        that a traditional burial or cremation is terrible for the environment? If you spent your life advocating
        for the working poor, the environment etc. doesn't it make sense to continue to do so until the very end?
        <br><br>
        In our rapidly evolving world, we often feel like we have lost control. But we can plan ahead to maintain
        our integrity, our self-respect, our wisdom and our courage. When it is time for us to go, and our energy transforms into
        something that no one else can see, prove or disprove,
        we need to take back this sacred transition of leaving this Earth for whatever lies ahead.

        &#8220;If we could actually see the energy that's constantly swirling within us and around us - forever
        processing our emotions and thoughts, always re-creating our reality to fit our beliefs and
        unceasingly and vigilantly protecting us - we might never feel alone.&#8221;
