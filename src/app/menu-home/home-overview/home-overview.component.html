    <h1>Our Modern World - Are We Really Healthy?</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="text-dark">
    Modern science and medicine inventions and innovations have been invaluable in providing us the ability to live longer lives.
    But are we actually healthier? Even more so, are we actually happier?

    In 1920–1922 life expectancy in Canada for men in was 58.8 years and life expectancy for women was 60.6 years.
    In 2018, life expectancy for men in Canada was 80.9 years and the life expectancy for women was 84.7 years.

    In past times, people died of acute illnesses such as flus, viruses and from accidents. Increases in safety such as seat belts
    for cars and vaccines for viruses, emergency room interventions, antibiotics etc. have been effective to the point where now only 30% of the population
    <i>(CHPCA Fact Sheet – Hospice Palliative Care in Canada 2014)</i> dies from an acute illness or a sudden accident.
    <br><br>
    This means, that 70% of us will eventually contract a chronic illness. People who have chronic issues
    are often left to fend on their own, without a definite plan for gaining back their health. They
    may go from doctor, to chiropractor, to internist to surgeon and in a worst case scenario,
    end up addicted to pain medications. They often hear the dreaded words "there is nothing more we can do".
    In all these cases the patient is handing over most of the responsibility
    for their health and well-being from - an all too often - ten minute consult".
    <br><br>
    The initial purpose of a hospital was to give help to those in immediate need due to accidents or acute illnesses. It was never
    meant to be the place we go if we are suffering from a chronic illness, let alone when we are dying. But the very sad fact is
    that most people, 70% of us, will die in a hospital <i>(CHPCA Fact Sheet – Hospice Palliative Care in Canada

    There is an obvious lack of ancient wisdom in all of this. Not that long ago it was very common for folks
    to go to their local <q>healer</q> whenever they or a family member were ill or in some kind of distress. If they
    were having a baby the midwife and/or the women of the village helped the mother give birth. If a person was
    sick they often had a wise elder, a herbalist or a doctor who did house calls. And in death, the family was there
    by their side, helping them transition.
    <br><br>
    It seems kind of insane that we are in this situation in most of the 1st world countries. How do we get back to
    taking responsibility for our own health? We have separated our bodies into parts and we have
    specialists who work on these parts and they send us for test after test. They may confer with one another but the doctor who is supposed to provide
    the big picture, the general practitioner, is often not equipped to put it all together - because it has been
    very effectively taken apart!
    <br><br>
    And yet, the Holistic approach is now the 'crazy' approach. Treating the body as an inter-communicating work of
    art that actually does know of each of it's parts is now deemed 'new age' and therefore unreliable.

    When you drill down, however you find beyond the mass, there is energy. It is what you are made of, period.
    Just as the blood in our body is continuously flowing for our lifetimes, energy is also at work throughout our
    lives. It is an intelligent, responsive system like every other system in the body that maintains balance. And
    it can be moved, re-directed, decreased in flow, increased in flow ... by you!
    <br><br>
    Along with eating healthy food, getting adequate exercise and challenging negativity, you can manipulate your own
    energy. Energy medicine provides a way for you to practice non-invasive, safe and effective methods to work with your own energy. You can
    learn techniques to correct imbalances and through education and self awareness, become your own advocate.

    <p><b><i>Energy Tip</i></b> :
      The concept of energy in your body is so foreign to most but it is actually right there all the time
      for you to play with.
      Start by looking at a white wall and then gaze gently at your fingertips.
      Eventually you may see a small outline around each finger, this is the inner Etheric layer of
      your Aura which could be white or any other color. It is the layer where all changes exist first before becoming
      manifested into matter.

    We can manage many of our health issues by working with our own energy system. This puts you back in charge of
    your life. What is equally important is to also be in charge of your own dying. The fact is 100% of us will die.
    But, as with our health, we would rather not think about it. But this new world of 2022 is bringing up changes in
    how we view just about everything.
    <br><br>
    Sexual orientation definitions are changing. Respect for our Indigineous cultures is increasing. Equality for
    people of color is making huge strides. The prejudice around aging is also being challenged. The way we
    choose to die is changing as well. Did you know that most funeral homes are owned by mega-corporations? Or
    that a traditional burial or cremation is terrible for the environment? If you spent your life advocating
    for the working poor, the environment etc. doesn't it make sense to continue to do so until the very end?
    <br><br>
    When it is time for us to go, and our energy transforms into something that no one else can see, prove or disprove,
    we need to take back this sacred transition of leaving this Earth for whatever lies ahead.

      &#8220;If we could actually see the energy that's constantly swirling within us and around us - forever
      processing our emotions and thoughts, always re-creating our reality to fit our beliefs and
      unceasingly and vigilantly protecting us - we might never feel alone.&#8221;
