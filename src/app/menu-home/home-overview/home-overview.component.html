        &#8220;Hospitals were never meant to be the place we go when we are dying - it was never meant to be a place where people live

        After looking at the facts, we have to realize that it is vitally important is to be in charge of your own impending death as
        much as possible. The fact is 100% of us will die, and of course we would rather not think about it. But this new
        world is bringing up changes in how we view just about everything. Sexual orientation definitions are changing. Respect for our
        Indigenous cultures is increasing. Equality for people of color is making huge strides. The prejudice around aging is also being
        challenged. The way we choose to die is changing as well.
        <br><br>
        Not so long ago, we all died at home, being cared for by our family and neighbors. It was a sad event of course, but it was
        considered just another part of the life experience. Family cared for the ill and dying and after death, loved ones and people in
        the community would gather at the home to pay their respects. The viewing allowed people to grieve and more importantly, to bear
        witness to the deceased. Food, music and celebrations honoring the person would follow. Burial was often in the family plot if
        they lived in the country or at the local church cemetery if they lived in the city.
        <br><br>
        The handling of death today is often a very different experience. In my work as an energy medicine practitioner and end-of-life
        doula I have heard countless stories of frustrated and angry relatives who were unable to provide a graceful death for their
        loved one. It isn't that the hospitals are failing necessarily, it is that because of the infinite ways in which a person can be
        'saved' a terminal person can be dragged back to life whether they want to or not.
        <br><br>
        What it comes down to is - as with taxes and life insurance and all those awful things, planning for your inevitable death is
        deemed essential, not just by doulas but is emphasized by the health care community as well. They don't like having to be in the
        position of making life changing decisions on your behalf, especially because, after all, they are strangers.

        Did you know that most funeral homes are owned by mega-corporations and that cemetery plots are often flipped for profit? Or that a
        traditional burial or cremation is terrible for the environment? If you spent your life advocating for the working class, or if you
        care about climate change - doesn't it make sense to make decisions and have an positive impact even after you leave this Earth?
        <br><br>
        Planning for your future care is not only essential for the baby boomer generation but is also so important that the Canadian
        government urges everyone over 19 to make an advanced care plan. Accidents happen at any age and taking the time to put together
        your wishes and beliefs shows compassion for your family who may have to make big decisions on your behalf.
        <br><br>
        In our rapidly evolving world, we often feel like we have lost control. But we can plan ahead to maintain our integrity, our
        self-respect, our wisdom and our courage. When it is time for us to go, and our energy transforms into something that no one else
        can see, prove or disprove, we can take back control of the sacred transition when leaving this Earth for whatever lies ahead.
