        The EDITH Form has been screenshot and is shown here for your information. It states:<br>
        "This form allows a Funeral Director to remove your body from a home without pronouncement of death. Pronouncement of death is
        not required by BC Law, although it is widely recognized that pronouncement is sound clinical and ethical practice for nurses and
        physicians."
        <br><br>
        "There may be circumstances when pronouncement is difficult or families choose to waive pronouncement. If a person dies in British
        Columbia, the death must be registered with the Vital Statistics Agency. A Medical Certificate of Death form is completed by the
        physician within 48 hours after a death. The medical certificate of death is forwarded to the funeral director who will register
        the death. The funeral director can then issue a death certificate and burial permit."

        A Notification of an Expected Death in the Home</a> form here. It must be completed by the your physician or a nurse practitioner
        and then sent to the funeral home before your death.

        There is also a

        </a>
        form that allows family to transport their loved one"s body to the funeral home or crematorium. This may seem strange, but it
        allows families to gather and have more time with the deceased, perhaps to have a wake or some other kind of ritual.
