        You may have never heard of an End of Life Doula or End of Life Advocate but in today's society and rapidly aging world, we are
        needed more than ever. With strains on hospitals, hospices, palliative care centers and working families,
        end of life care doulas fill in where the cracks exist.
        <br><br>
        We provide many services, from helping you create your own advanced health care plan, to sitting at bedside
        with your loved one, to arranging ceremonies, funerals, legacy projects and providing support for not just
        your loved one, but for the family and their caregivers as well.
        <br><br>
        The truth we can't run away from is that some day we all leave this earth. What you choose to leave behind
        could be either a huge mess for family to sort or a well planned legacy that your family will benefit from and
        appreciate.
        <br><br>
        Planning ahead isn't just important for their sake but for your own as well. Because if you end up at the
        hospital some day without any kind of thought to this, your future could end having it decided by a stranger who
        probably really wished he or she didn't have to make the hard decisions.

        <h2>The Death Positive Movement Principles</h2>
    </div>

    <ul class="dark-list">
        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that by hiding death and dying behind closed doors we do more harm than good to our society.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that the culture of silence around death should be broken through discussion, gatherings, art,
            innovation, and scholarship.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that talking about and engaging with my inevitable death is not morbid, but displays a natural
            curiosity about the human condition.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that the dead body is not dangerous, and that everyone should be empowered (should they wish
            to be) to be involved in care for their own dead.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that the laws that govern death, dying and end-of-life care should ensure that a person’s
            wishes are honored, regardless of sexual, gender, racial or religious identity.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that my death should be handled in a way that does not do great harm to the environment.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that my family and friends should know my end-of-life wishes, and that I should have the
            necessary paperwork to back-up those wishes.
        </li>

        <li class="list-med-item">
            I believe that my open, honest advocacy around death can make a difference, and can change culture.

        <h2>What Happens if I Don't Plan Ahead?</h2>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        If you are in an accident or suffer a critical illness and end up in Emergency and are incapable of
        answering for yourself, the first thing the hospital will look for is information about your next of kin.
        They will start at the top of what is referred to as the Temporary Substitute Decision Maker (TSDM) list. The list, created by B.C. Law, must be
        followed if you have not created an end of life care plan (or one can not be found). A health care provider will start at the top of this list
        and move down the list until they find someone who will agree to be your TSDM. If that first person is not qualified or is unavailable to
        advocate for you, they will then move down the list. By law they must go by the hierarchy set out on this form.
        <br><br>
        To qualify as a TSDM, the people placed on the list must:

        <li class="list-item">have no dispute with you</li>
        <li class="list-item">have been in contact with you within the year before you need care</li>

        <h2>Why Should I Care About This?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        Let's say you are separated from your spouse but not yet divorced. Maybe you now have a new love in your
        life, who at this point
        has no legal association with you. Should you get in the situation described above, where you have lost your
        ability to advocate
        for yourself, they will contact the first person on the list, your ex. They will not even consider your new
        person as they are nowhere
        on this list. If the idea of this scares you, then know that you have a say in ensuring your wishes for care
        are known.
        Setting up your own Substitute Decision Maker keeps you in control of your own life.

        &#8220;We find that people open up to death doulas in ways they simply can’t with family and friends (so
        much emotion/baggage), social workers, clinical staff or chaplains. Doulas are trained to
        come from an absolutely objective, nonjudgmental place; they go where they need to go emotionally.&#8221;

        <h2>How Can I Ensure I Have My Say?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = "dark-copy">
        The easiest step to take is to fill out what is called a Representative Section 9 in B.C. You can read more
        about <b><a routerLink="/chooseRepresentative" fragment="repNine">Representative Section 9</a></b> here. Basically this form will allow
        health care personnel to contact the person or persons you specifically chose to advocate for you.
        <br><br>
        The Representative Section 9 form is considered essential for anyone over 19 regardless of their health.
        Click <a routerLink="/repNineWizard">here to access my Representative Section-9 Wizard</a>
        and fill it out now.
        <br><br>
        If you are older, ill or want to be as decisive about your care as you can, Rep-9 doesn’t leave a lot of room for additional requests or
        considerations related to your care.
        This situation is rectified with an <b><a routerLink="/chooseRepresentative" fragment="acplan">Advanced Care Directive</a></b>.
        This plan puts you back in the driver’s seat.
        <br><br>
        We have made our own decisions throughout our life, what careers to follow, whether to have children, where to
        live etc. It makes complete sense that we should also be able to make detailed decisions about our death. The
        problem is that the subject can be upsetting for your or your family. Even if you want to discuss this, often
        times your family doesn’t want to go there with you.
        <br><br>
        However, without any kind of acknowledgement that we will all die some day and that it is wise to prepare for
        it ahead of time, we may fall victim to being ‘cared for’ that goes against of everything we believe in.
        Taking the time to write an Advanced Care Directive can save you and your family from the
        stress of having to make decisions that they might not even be aware that you are for or against.
        As long as you are capable of making your own health care decisions you will be the authority on your own behalf.
        <br><br>
        Let's say you have chosen your Representative(s) and that form is all completed and stored safely along with
        your Will, Insurance papers etc. But if in many cases, you may have worries or concerns that go beyond general
        directives. Putting these Advanced Care Plan wishes onto paper will help your Representatives and the medical
        community know better what you choose to say yes to and what you want to say no to.
