        Using low energy magnets is a great way to help with pain and inflammation.
        Magnets align the cells to their optimal positions so that instead of being haphazard they line
        up north end of one cell to south end of another. They also releive congestion because when properly aligned
        they leave space between each, thereby allowing in more oxygen. Oxygen is needed for any kind of imflammation
        which is a common contributor to pain.

        You need to know North from South because you only want to put the North side of a magnet on your body. You
        must avoid putting them directly on or near your spine.
        To align to the Earth you can tape the magnets to
        the bottoms of your feet so that the south side faces the earth. You can also simply spin a magnet around
        your feet, in and out between the toes, on the foot bottoms, weaving back and forth out to about 6 inches.
        <img src="assets/images/pain/buttonMagnets.jpg" class="images" title="Button Magnets"/>

        I have found that applying small magnet 'buttons' to areas where rashes appear, which are a result of
        imflammation. They can take away the itch allowing the area time to heal.

        <h3>Testing for Magnet Sensitivity</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        Although these magnets are very low wattage and are very safe, some people are sensitive to them. As
        well, when
        you wear them, keep aware of any anxiety or discomfort that means it's time to take them off.

        <img src="assets/images/pain/howMagnetsWork.jpg" class="images" title="Magnet Therapy"/>

        You can generally put the North side of a magnet on your skin for up to 8 hours. The South side is
        another matter,
        because it disperses energy outwards, it should only be used with great caution, basically leave it's
        use up to a practitioner.

        <h3>Help for Painful Restless Leg Syndrome</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        A good technique for 'restless leg syndrome' - trapped leg energy - is to rub down your arms and press
        and massage each finger. Rub down your legs and then move to your feet-
        paying lots of attention to the areas between your fingers and toes. There are lots of meridian
        end and beginning points in the feet and hands. This helps release all that built up energy that
        makes Restless Legs so uncomfortable.

        <img src="assets/images/pain/spoonFeet.jpg" class='images' title="Spooning your Feet"/>

        Finish with spooning your feet. Use a stainless steel spoon which acts like a very low grade magnet and
        rub the
        back of the spoon all over the underside of your feet. If you want to try taping a magnet (north side to
        skin)
        to the bottoms of your feet you can also give this a try. This grounding ritual is a great thing to add
        to your pre-bedtime ritual.

        <h2>Relieve Inflammation in Your Digestive System</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        Digestive issues can range from the occasional bout of heartburn after a spicy meal to Irritable Bowel Syndrome to Chrohns disease to Cancer of the Colon.
        Clearly our digestive tract is important to take care of. Every nutritionist out there says diet, diet, diet, but what kind of diet actually works for these
        myriad of complaints?
        <br><br>
        I am not a dietician or nutritionist but I did notice the changes in my digestion once I stopped eating beef, pork, fish, eggs, milk and poultry. I used to
        have night-time bouts of diahrrea that only Imodium could help. Now well now - I never have this problem.
        <br><br>
        I am not saying you necessarily have to become a vegan to sort out your digestive issues but we all do know that red meat tends to get stuck in
        the large intestine forming "pouches". This can lead to conditions like diverticulitis when these pouches become infected or inflammed. NutritionFacts.org
        says that "with a typical Western diet, up to 12 grams of protein can escape digestion, and when it reaches the colon, it can be turned into toxic substances
        like ammonia. This degradation of undigested protein in the colon is called putrefaction; so,
        a little meat can actually end up putrefying in our colon. The problem is that some of the by-products of this putrefaction process can be toxic."
        They go on to say "Because of animal protein and processed food intake, the standard American diet may contain five or six times more sulfur than a diet centered
        around unprocessed plant foods. This may help explain the rarity of inflammatory bowel disease among those eating traditional whole food, plant-based diets".
        <br><br>
        So as with everything, in order to study yourself you need to do little experiments on yourself. Go a day without eating, just drinking water (if it is okay with
        your doctor) and see how you feel the next day. Or cut out carbs or meat or alchohol for a bit and see if anything improves. I thought all the beans I ate might
        produce a lot of gas (ahem) but after the first few weeks (ahem) I have not had any issues.
        <br><br>
        So diet and experimentation is important. Please remember that your doctor has about 4 hours of nutritional training in all her or his years of study. There are
        lots of unhealthy doctors! I find other people's stories to be the best teacher, check out YouTube, Reddit and other social media sites to find people to share with.
        <br><br>
        As for me, I am vegan but I am not a puritan about it. I love olive oil and avocados and nachos and I eat the faux meats, milks and cheeses. I also fast. Right now as I
        write this, I am doing the fasting method OMAD (one meal a day). I have lost some stubborn weight and I can finally see my ribs peeking out again. At present
        I eat 4 days of OMAD and then Friday to Sunday I play it by ear.
        <br><br>
        The success of fasting for weight loss is
        The great thing about fasting is you can start and stop at any time and you can do it around your schedule. Don't beleive the media that says you will be a little waif, I am
        really active and since coffee is allowed, I don't get the headaches they warn you about.
        I find it super easy to skip breakfast and lunch and I enjoy preparing dinner more as it is more of an event. So .. enough about food.

        <h3>We Can't Ignore our Stress</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        HopkinsMedicine.org says this about your digestive system: "Hidden in the walls of the digestive system, this “brain in your gut”
        is revolutionizing medicine’s understanding of the links between digestion, mood, health and even the way you think.
        Scientists call this little brain the enteric nervous system (ENS). And it’s not so little. The ENS is two thin layers of
        more than 100 million nerve cells lining your gastrointestinal tract from esophagus to rectum."
        <br><br>

        "ENS may trigger big emotional shifts experienced by people coping with irritable bowel
        syndrome (IBS) and functional bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, pain and stomach upset."

        Jay Pasricha, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology, has this to say about ENS:
        “The enteric nervous system doesn’t seem capable of thought as we know it, but it communicates back and forth
        with our big brain—with profound results. For decades, researchers and doctors thought that anxiety and depression contributed
        to these problems. But our studies and others show that it may also be the other way around,” Pasricha says. Researchers are finding evidence
        that irritation in the gastrointestinal system may send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) that trigger mood changes.
        <br><br>
        “These new findings may explain why a higher-than-normal percentage of people with IBS and functional bowel problems develop depression and
        anxiety,” Pasricha says. “That’s important, because up to 30 to 40 percent of the population has functional bowel problems at some point.”
        <br><br>
        In other words, these digestive illnesses may be <b>causing</b> the anxiety and depression you feel, not the other way around (that anxiety and
        depression contribute to digestive problems). That being said, both areas need to be worked with.
    </div>

    <div class="headings-dark">
        <h3>How Energy Medicine can Help</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        Medicine is now treating the out of balance ENS by prescribing anti-depressants and cognitive therapies. They say these therapies and drugs work on
        calming the ENS which then communicates more 'all is well' to the brain. So your anxiety triggers your out of control digestive system's nervous system and your
        unbalanced ENS triggers your anxiety. So we want to help not just with anxiety and depression symptoms but we want to work with all of the organs and meridians
        that make up your digestive system.
    </div>

    <div class="headings-dark">
        <h3>Digestive Tract Meridians</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="text-dark">
        The Meridians are named for the organs they protect and serve. So there is a Spleen (Pancreas) Meridian, a Large Intestine Meridian, a Small Intestine Meridian,
        a Gallbladder Meridian, a Liver Meridian and a Stomach Meridian. Spleen and Liver are YIN meridians. This means that they are always working, processing,
        transferring nutrients, maintaining balance. They are never off duty. Large and Small Intestines, Gallbladder and Stomach Meridians are YANG - they work
        when needed (when we eat) and rest when not needed.
        <br><br>
        We know that, in general that if YANG meridian's organs are your problem they are likely over energy. If YIN meridian's organs are your issue they are likely under energy.
        This is important because we can test for these assumptions and then either take out the excess or add in more energy respectively. We do this with
        various means, working on the meridian points via tapping, tracing, acupressure or massage. We can also work on the meridians by treating their
        Neurovascular and Neurolymphatic points. Deep massage techniques can move the energy as can just holding points. And we can also do a treatment that
        takes energy out, puts more in and then stops the process.

        <br><br>Sedate your problem meridian to relieve your pain. See <a routerLink="/discoverMeridians">the meridians page</a> to find out how to sedate.

        The Stomach's meridian begins under the eyes and ends at the second toe. This is a top-down flow.
        With Heartburn your stomach acid is travelling back up your Esophagus. This is obviously backwards to Stomach's
        ideal meridian flow.
        Try to fix your Heartburn by tracing Stomach forward 3 times to get it flowing correctly again. You may have to
        repeat this process multiple times until Stomach gets the message.
