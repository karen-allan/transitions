            <h2>Trying an Energy Session</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="dark-copy">
            With energy medicine treatments I work out of my home treatment room or remotely via Zoom. I use protocols
            and treatments to release energy, bring energy into your body and redistribute it throughout your body.
            A session is approximately 90 minutes.
            <br><br>
            Preparing for an energy medicine session is like preparing for a massage, in that you want to be
            clean with freshly washed hair. Wear comfortable, loose clothing, with clean socks. If you can
            avoid wearing a belt or an underwire bra as these can impede the energy flow. Please avoid using perfumes or colognes. I
            generally have an atomizer with a nice aromatherapy scent but if you are allergic please let me
            know ahead of time and I will not use it.
            <br><br>
            Unlike a massage, you are fully clothed throughout the process. Initially I will take your health history and treatment goals
            and discuss with you what you would like me to help you with. I will test your basic energies using Kinesiology based
            muscle testing. If you have any injuries or weak arms or legs I can use other methods of testing as well.
            <br><br>
            It is at about 15 minutes in that I start to gather an idea of where to go, based
            on where your energy systems is leading me. That is the amazing and fun part of energy work!
            After testing, I will perform an energy balancer that is very much like a massage.

            Distance sessions are done over Zoom or Skype and while there is obviously no hands on work, can still be
            very beneficial. It puts much more emphasis on the client learning how to perform many of the techniques
            themselves. They are between 60 or 90 minutes and are perfect if you don't live in my area (Vancouver) or
            if you have issues with mobility.
            <br><br>
            One thing you can say with certainty is that each energy medicine session will never follow an assumed path.
            Instead your energy system will lead me to where I need to go. As an energy detective, I may have an idea of
            what I will work on when you walk in the door. But as soon as you are on the table, your energy runs the show.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the session I may give you some handouts, a bit of homework or some advice about how to balance
            your energies on your own. You can come back as often as you like and it is great if you also take notes on your progress.

                    Karen Allan has been my Energy Medicine Therapist since April 2020. She is very knowledgeable and dedicated to her clients.
                    She is very caring and she is genuinely determined to help. In addition, she is very friendly and relates easily to people.
                    I have an autoimmune condition. Karen worked on establishing the flow of energy in my whole body. Ever since I started
                    having energy sessions with Karen, I noticed improvement in my overall energy levels and I started sleeping better.
                    I warmly recommend Karen Allan to be your Energy Medicine Therapist.

                    On my first appointment with Karen I had a breakthrough! I was so thrilled. I had rhinitis. After this appointment it was gone.
                    I felt like a new person. It began returning after a few days but on contacting Karen for support I was able to begin rubbing
                    certain areas on my face. Now any-time it threatens to return I rubs these areas and it‚Äôs gone. It has been four months since
                    my first appointment and I feel great. I have had several other appointments since then where we focus on other areas.
                    Would I recommend Karen and EEM? Absolutely.
                    I found Karen to be knowledgeable, open to my many questions, supportive and easy to communicate with online, responding
                    quickly with great detail. Thanks Karen

                    Karen has the gift of providing both calming or supporting energy work to her clients. She really feels what your body needs.
                    She puts a powerful emphasis on embodiment. During any treatment you will feel her love to help others. She does work intensely
                    with your energy fields doesn‚Äôt matter its your meridians, chakra or aura. If you go open minded into her treatment you will
                    definitely benefit from it. However keep in mind that you perhaps need a few continuous treatments to correct the energy flow
                    in your body and break a pattern which has developed over time. But even after the first treatment you will feel positive changes,
                    they may just don‚Äôt stay for too long if you don‚Äôt start working on your energy flow regularly.

                    As I was reading Donna Eden‚Äôs book Energy Medicine I realized that I wanted to have a ‚Äúhands on‚Äù experience from a certified practitioner.
                    I was so fortunate to find Karen Allan! She exceeded my expectations. She is welcoming, knowledgeable, caring, helpful and encouraging.
                    I thoroughly enjoy my sessions with Karen, in the comfort and serenity of her treatment room. I get so much out of every visit;
                    each one is different depending on what needs soothing attention. I leave feeling calm, ‚Äúsofter‚Äù, healthier, inspired and joyful and
                    I‚Äôm equipped with energy exercises I can do at home.

                    I can hardly wait to get another wonderful session from Karen. She has an amazing healing touch in her hands. It is something she just luckily has,
                    as a great foundation, not even including all the knowledge she has acquired over the years of study. I appreciate her gifts she gives to people,
                    with her open heart, her love as well as being so firmly grounded üôèüèª amazing !!!

                    Karen's energies are truly alive and open. I just love her energy, humor and integrity. She makes me happy üòÉ
                    Thank you for bringing your skills to the Vancouver area. I hope your presence brings more awareness to the
                    community of Vancouver. We certainly need to start an energy playground here! So far small steps but that is
                    how everything evolves. Small steps are grounding steps. I am looking forward to having many more sessions with Karen. ü¶ã
