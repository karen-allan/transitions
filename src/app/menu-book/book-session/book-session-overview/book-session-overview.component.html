        With energy medicine treatments I work out of my home treatment room or remotely via Zoom. I use protocols
        and treatments to release energy, bring energy into your body and redistribute it throughout your body.
        A session is approximately 90 minutes. If it is a first session, you need to fill out and bring the
        Intake Form for an Energy Session.
        <br><br>
        Preparing for an energy medicine session is like preparing for a massage, in that you want to be
        clean with freshly washed hair. Wear comfortable, loose clothing, with clean socks. If you can
        avoid wearing a belt or an underwire bra as these can impede the energy flow. Please avoid using perfumes or colognes. I
        generally have an atomizer with a nice aromatherapy scent but if you are allergic please let me
        know ahead of time and I will not use it.
        <br><br>
        Unlike a massage, you are fully clothed throughout the process. Initially I will take your health history and treatment goals
        and discuss with you what you would like me to help you with. I will test your basic energies using Kinesiology based
        muscle testing. If you have any injuries or weak arms or legs I can use other methods of testing as well.
        <br><br>
        It is at about 15 minutes in that I start to gather an idea of where to go, based
        on where your energy systems is leading me. That is the amazing and fun part of energy work!
        After testing, I will perform an energy balancer that is very much like a massage.

        Distance sessions are done over Zoom or Skype and while there is obviously no hands on work, can still be
        very beneficial. It puts much more emphasis on the client learning how to perform many of the techniques
        themselves. They are between 60 or 90 minutes and are perfect if you don't live in my area (Vancouver) or
        if you have issues with mobility.
        <br><br>
        One thing you can say with certainty is that each energy medicine session will never follow an assumed path.
        Instead your energy system will lead me to where I need to go. As an energy detective, I may have an idea of
        what I will work on when you walk in the door. But as soon as you are on the table, your energy runs the show.
        <br><br>
        At the end of the session I may give you some handouts, a bit of homework or some advice about how to balance
        your energies on your own. You can come back as often as you like and it is great if you also take notes on your progress.
