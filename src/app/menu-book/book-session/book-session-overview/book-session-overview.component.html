        With energy medicine treatments I work out of my home treatment room or remotely via Zoom. I use protocols
        and treatments to release energy, bring energy into your body and redistribute it throughout your body.
        A session is approximately 90 minutes.
        <br><br>
        Preparing for an energy medicine session is like preparing for a massage, in that you want to be
        clean with freshly washed hair. Wear comfortable, loose clothing, with clean socks. If you can
        avoid wearing a belt or an underwire bra as these can impede the energy flow. Please avoid using perfumes or colognes. I
        generally have an atomizer with a nice aromatherapy scent but if you are allergic please let me
        know ahead of time and I will not use it.
        <br><br>
        Unlike a massage, you are fully clothed throughout the process. Initially I will take your health history and treatment goals
        and discuss with you what you would like me to help you with. I will test your basic energies using Kinesiology based
        muscle testing. If you have any injuries or weak arms or legs I can use other methods of testing as well.
        <br><br>
        It is at about 15 minutes in that I start to gather an idea of where to go, based
        on where your energy systems is leading me. That is the amazing and fun part of energy work!
        After testing, I will perform an energy balancer that is very much like a massage.

        Distance sessions are done over Zoom or Skype and while there is obviously no hands on work, can still be
        very beneficial. It puts much more emphasis on the client learning how to perform many of the techniques
        themselves. They are between 60 or 90 minutes and are perfect if you don't live in my area (Vancouver) or
        if you have issues with mobility.
        <br><br>
        One thing you can say with certainty is that each energy medicine session will never follow an assumed path.
        Instead your energy system will lead me to where I need to go. As an energy detective, I may have an idea of
        what I will work on when you walk in the door. But as soon as you are on the table, your energy runs the show.
        <br><br>
        At the end of the session I may give you some handouts, a bit of homework or some advice about how to balance
        your energies on your own. You can come back as often as you like and it is great if you also take notes on your progress.

                Karen Allan has been my Energy Medicine Therapist since April 2020. She is very knowledgeable and dedicated to her clients.
                She is very caring and she is genuinely determined to help. In addition, she is very friendly and relates easily to people.
                I have an autoimmune condition. Karen worked on establishing the flow of energy in my whole body. Ever since I started
                having energy sessions with Karen, I noticed improvement in my overall energy levels and I started sleeping better.
                I warmly recommend Karen Allan to be your Energy Medicine Therapist.

                On my first appointment with Karen I had a breakthrough! I was so thrilled. I had rhinitis. After this appointment it was gone.
                I felt like a new person. It began returning after a few days but on contacting Karen for support I was able to begin rubbing
                certain areas on my face. Now any-time it threatens to return I rubs these areas and it‚Äôs gone. It has been four months since
                my first appointment and I feel great. I have had several other appointments since then where we focus on other areas.
                Would I recommend Karen and EEM? Absolutely.
                I found Karen to be knowledgeable, open to my many questions, supportive and easy to communicate with online, responding
                quickly with great detail. Thanks Karen

                Karen has the gift of providing both calming or supporting energy work to her clients. She really feels what your body needs.
                She puts a powerful emphasis on embodiment. During any treatment you will feel her love to help others. She does work intensely
                with your energy fields doesn‚Äôt matter its your meridians, chakra or aura. If you go open minded into her treatment you will
                definitely benefit from it. However keep in mind that you perhaps need a few continuous treatments to correct the energy flow
                in your body and break a pattern which has developed over time. But even after the first treatment you will feel positive changes,
                they may just don‚Äôt stay for too long if you don‚Äôt start working on your energy flow regularly.

                Before seeing Karen - "I'd like to inquiry about (you) seeing my 98-year-old mother. She is suffering from chronic
                Bronchitis and is on her 4th round of antibiotics."
                <br><br>
                After first visit - "Hi Karen, thank you. Mama is feeling much better and we can‚Äôt thank you enough. She seemed
                her old self. Chipper and much happier and more energy. Thanks again."

                From a fellow practitioner: "I can hardly wait to get wonderful session from you one day, I remember last time in Kamloops, that you
                have an amazing healing touch in your hands, something you just luckily have, as a great foundation, besides all the knowledge we have
                to acquire over time. I can appreciate your gifts you give to people, with open heart, your love and being
                grounded üôèüèª amazing !!!"

                Your energies are truly alive and open to connect to healthy anchors. When you partnershiped with Becca
                I was able to observe a beautiful dance of violets vibrate around your neck. There was a steam of clear values
                pouring down from your throat towards her indigo color hovering above her head. The colors were mushing and
                flowing in a lovely exchange. All around your throat was a disk of violet purple rotating like a record.
                It was thin and extended about 8 inches.
                I just love your energy, humor and integrity. You make me happy üòÉ Thank you for making the time to be with us.
                My deep desire is to bring a momentum to our/your community in Vancouver and jump start an energy playground here.
                So far small steps but that is how everything evolves. Small steps are grounding steps. I am looking forward to spend
                more time with you. ü¶ã
