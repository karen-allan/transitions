    <h2>You Don't Have to Do it Alone</h2>
</div>

<div class="content-dark-copy margin-top-2">
    <p>
        You may have never heard of an End of Life Doula or End of Life Advocate but in today's society and rapidly aging world, we are
        needed more than ever. With strains on hospitals, hospices, palliative care centers and working families, end of life care doulas
        fill in where the cracks exist.
        <br><br>
        We provide many services, from helping you create your own advanced health care plan, to sitting at bedside with your loved one,
        to arranging ceremonies, funerals, legacy projects and providing support for not just your loved one, but for the family and
        their caregivers as well.
        <br><br>
        The truth we can't run away from is that some day we all leave this earth. What you choose to leave behind could be either a huge
        mess for family to sort or a well planned legacy that your family will benefit from and appreciate.
        <br><br>
        Planning ahead isn't just important for their sake but for your own as well. Because if you end up at the hospital some day
        without any kind of thought to this, your future could end having it decided by a stranger who probably really wished he or she
        didn't have to make the hard decisions.

    <h2>Doulas Support You:</h2>

    <p>
        We are trained to act as witnesses on your very last journey. Like birth, death is a monumental endeavor that we all must face. So
        why do we fear it? Of course, we fear pain. Pain can be controlled fairly well in most first world countries. What we think of as
        pain, is often the laboured breathing that happens as people are unable to expel mucous from their trachea. It sounds like it
        hurts but it does not. There are medications to help with nausea and swelling. There are machines that can help with shortness of
        breath. In fact, many people die quite peacefully, having reconciled themselves to the situation.
        <br><br>
        There are others of course, who die fighting, who die angry, who die alone. Like life - dying can be hard. Our job as Doulas is to
        make the death as good as it can be. You may not resolve everything with family, but you may be able to control much of who is at
        your bedside and who is not.
        <br><br>
        There is often a lot of family conflict. There are a variety of roles that people naturally fall into depending on their
        personality and all have their place and should be respected. But a good Doula will try to balance out the dynamics so that the
        focus is back on you, not them.
        <br><br>
        We do not give advice, unless asked. We are not allowed to touch you after death but we are allowed to set up the ceremony you
        have requested. You may wish to be dressed by your family, to wear your favorite hat or scarf. We can arrange that. We know that
        your family will be up to their eyeballs in doing all the details needed to be done and we are there to assist in any way. We
        will not deny you your feelings, we will not patronize you. We will not put our spiritual beliefs above your own, in fact we will
        never discuss what we think about God - unless asked.
        <br><br>
        We will not give you medication or perform any kind of medical intervention on you. Even those doulas who are trained as doctors
        can not treat the patient unless they are also their doctor. I as a trained
        <a target="new" routerLink="/bookSession" fragment="bookEMSession"><b> Energy Medicine Practitioner</b></a> can and will be happy
        to do pain and stress reducing treatments on you - if requested by you or the family.
        <br><br>
        I will let you and your family know that your sleeping more than usual is part of the dying process. There will be times when
        they think you are sleeping but you have actually moved into an unconsciousness state. They may worry that you aren't eating or
        drinking enough but losing interest in food is totally normal. Knowing that you are going through normal stages of dying can make
        you and your family more reassured that they are not failing you.
        <br><br>
        I will maintain my composure as much as possible but I will also be empathetic, sympathetic and loving, knowing that I have the
        profound honour of bearing witness to this event. Reading your and your family's body language and using all my senses to pick up
        the atmosphere in the room, I will quietly leave or address the situation as needed. I acknowledge that the grief is yours and
        yours alone. I will not leave unless asked, I will not abandon you or your family and if requested, I will stay on after so that
        we can go over it all again in two months time or whenever your family wishes. While I hope that my experience teaches you about
        the dying process I know that I am also learning so much from each and every session.

    <h2>The Death Positive Movement Principles</h2>
</div>

<ul class="content-dark-list">
    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that by hiding death and dying behind closed doors we do more harm than good to our society.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that the culture of silence around death should be broken through discussion, gatherings, art, innovation, and
        scholarship.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that talking about and engaging with my inevitable death is not morbid, but displays a natural curiosity about the
        human condition.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that the dead body is not dangerous, and that everyone should be empowered (should they wish to be) to be involved in
        care for their own dead.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that the laws that govern death, dying and end-of-life care should ensure that a person’s wishes are honored,
        regardless of sexual, gender, racial or religious identity.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that my death should be handled in a way that does not do great harm to the environment.
    </li>

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that my family and friends should know my end-of-life wishes, and that I should have the necessary paperwork to back-up
        those wishes.

    <li class="list-item">
        I believe that my open, honest advocacy around death can make a difference, and can change culture.</li>

        &#8220;We find that people open up to death doulas in ways they simply can’t with family and friends (so much emotion/baggage),
        social workers, clinical staff or chaplains. Doulas are trained to come from an absolutely objective, nonjudgmental place; they
        go where they need to go emotionally.&#8221;

        What I learned with my End of Life Doula training opened my eyes up to the many things we ignore because, of course, it is an
        uncomfortable subject. But avoiding the obvious fact that we all die someday can lead to pain, confusion, hurt, anger and financial mistakes.
        <br><br>
        You may worry about your financial situation - that the wrong family member will take charge of your finances and/or health
        should you lose the ability to speak for yourself. There are many ways to avoid this scenario.
        <br><br>
        You may have heard about EDITH, Expected Death in the Home and want to learn more about it. Or the No CPR form, the DNR form, the
        advance directives for requesting or refusing life extending treatments. You may have heard about MAID, Medical Assistance in
        Dying and need to know if you qualify. You may be someone who has always cared about the environment and want to know more about
        these 'green burials'. You may be unable to speak to your family members about your wishes and plans because they are unable to
        hear you. I can advocate for you.
        <br><br>
        You may want to put on a Celebration of Life while you are still here to enjoy it.  If you are a caregiver you may be afraid to
        witness the dying process. I will hopefully, calm your worries. The fact is, most people are able to die without pain if properly
        medicated. And studies have shown that if families are able to speak openly with each other and come to an acceptance of what is
        to come, they face the situation with considerably more comfort and peace.
        <br><br>
        I have different forms for you to fill out depending on if you are the caregiver for a dying loved one, if you are the patient
        who has been given a time limit to your life or if you just want to plan ahead to avoid putting the burden on your family members
        after you are gone. As long as you are over 19 and of sound mind you are encouraged to put a plan together so you can live your
        life knowing that you and your family are protected in case of an emergency or crisis. Then you can store it away, and go live
        your life to the fullest!

        As well I offer my energy medicine skills to those who are dying, are in pain, in fear, uncomfortable, scared or angry. I have
        techniques to lessen swelling that causes pain as well as calming techniques to take some of the fear away. I can work with
        patients at whatever level they are at and provide care that brings them the most comfort. I can work on a patient directly or in
        their energy field if touch is not wanted.
        <br><br>
        Many of my energy medicine clients are suffering from the loss of a parent, a spouse, sister, brother and I can help relieve some
        of their sorrow and stress - by listening and holding space for them to grieve. Crying is absolutely part of the healing process
        and working with energy can help release much pent up emotion.
