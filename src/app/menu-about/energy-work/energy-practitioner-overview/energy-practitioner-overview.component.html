    Coming back from Victoria I signed up for a 4 month online course with Eden Energy Medicine (now
    called Eden Method). I was amazed at the wealth of information given to us during this course.
    I was intrigued, but skeptical and frankly, scared. This was not the me that I had been developing
    over the last few decades. This was utterly the opposite!
    <br><br>

    So there I was at loose ends but I was being pulled more and more into this new energy world.
    Even before the end of the course, I enquired about becoming a practitioner.
    And much to my delight, I was told that there was room for
    one more student in the program that was starting the following week.
    I took the Greyhound bus to Kamloops, B.C. and started my training with a class of 10 students, 2 teachers and an assistant.

    Having always achieved good marks in the academic world, walking into exams with confidence that I
    had every fact stored in my brain, I was suddenly terrified.
    The program challenged me in unique ways, it challenged me to my core. This wasn't just about the ability to memorize facts or follow the
    logic in code, this was about trusting yourself enough to lay your hands on another human being and connect
    with them in a new way. I certainly didn't feel like I had any great abilities in this capacity. But I did feel
    one thing, an overwhelming need to do this.

    The pressure was intense, with demo exams, written exams and
    so much information to learn, absorb and understand. But I made it and then crazily enough, signed up for year two!

    Second year was taught in Phoenix, Arizona to approximately 100 students from around the world.
    Although most students were from the US, many practitioners flew in from Australia, Brazil, England,
    New Zealand, Israel and like me - Canada.

<!--    <img src="assets/images/about/aboutPhoenix.jpg" class='images' alt="Phoenix, Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">-->
    <br><br>
    The students were mostly women but women of all ages, from 20 somethings to 70 somethings. I was
    told that one of the instructors was a dynamo in her 80s, still teaching and lecturing.
    There were nurses, physiotherapists, doctors, principals, police detectives, engineers, ex-cops,
    business owners, acupuncturists, midwifes, massage therapists, Chinese Medicine doctors, naturopaths,
    Broadway dancers, accountants, artists, Reiki Masters, ex-marines, professional singers,
    psychologists, teachers and more.

    Some had overcome terrible diseases like Cancer, some were still fighting them. Each and every student had incredible
    stories of life challenges and victories. I listened as they talked about death, divorce, suicide, the pains of having babies,
    the pains of having teenagers and the pain of having adult children:). One had been raised by Holy Bible thumping Evangalists,
    one was blind, getting help from a friend, one had PTSD from his time in Iraq. The bravest I think, were the physicians, nurses
    and physician assistants - going against mainstream medicine.

    Year 3 was an post-certification advanced year taught in San Diego, California with about 50 of us.
    The first fall class spent in a god awful Holiday Inn. The next winter class I shared an Airbnb with
    some lovely Americans (this was a big deal for me as I always wanted my own space
    to recuperate after class). But my Airbnb roomies were an unbeleivably wonderful crew of friends. I met so many
    other interesting people I now call friends.

    I decided I needed to attend Year 3 as we were required
    to perform 100 sessions on as many different clients as we could find. I felt like I had all this
    theory floating around in my head, but needed to put it to practice. I needed, once again, to step
    out of the safety of academia and into the world of hands on sessions.

    I heard stories of bravery, tragedy, loss and survival and
    was brought to tears many times just looking around the big conference room at all the loving souls. Donna's daughter,
    Tanya would lead each day with the Daily Energy Routine, Tanya version. It involved music, movement and fun. But it also
    involved being okay with looking silly.

    Donna always took the time out of her extremely busy schedule to get on stage and teach us some of her techniques. It was
    truly like watching a master at work. I am a person who is very hyper-aware of people I feel are giving
    off an insincere vibe and I have never been a follower. But I have to say, when I met Donna I was literally
    buzzing for hours after. She is one of the blessed on Earth who has a tremendous gift. She doesn't just
    smile at you, she looks at you like you are amazing, like she is impressed by your very essence.

    Since she can literally see your energy, everyone is a little nervous when she opens herself up to view you (normally
    she shuts that down, or she would be overwhelmed just walking down the street). Many worried that she would
    see something black and dark and scary - but she really only sees your light. She told me my Life Color is Violet
    that I am an old soul and 'truly wonderous'. She is the truly wonderous one!

    I know that many people think that energy medicine is just a bunch of nonsensical woo woo, a
    new age practice that takes no critical thought or intelligence to master. However I found out very quickly
    that the level of study and commitment was just as intense as was my computer science education. And although the level
    of knowledge was vast and and challenging, it was nothing compared to the level of emotional and personal
    growth it demanded.

    <img src="assets/images/about/aboutMeTokyo.jpg" class="images" alt="Me and Tree in Tokyo" title="Me and Tree in Tokyo">

    Even after 3 years of study, however, I am still searching for more answers, researching new concepts and expanding my
    knowledge about energy. With that, it is my hope that I can help not only put into words some of the basic concepts I have
    learned but I hope to put them together in an easy to understand format for you.
    <br><br>
    I believe that this information should be shared, not provided only after you send me your email address, or sign up for
    this free course or this free event that starts a torrent of spam to your email account. I want to share,
    partly for my own sake. We learned so much, so many different protocols and theories that you have to stay engaged
    to retain it all. When I write about it, I research and learn more so it helps me and hopefully you too.

    <br><br>

    That being said, there are so many protocols that we were taught that can only be performed by qualified practitioners.
    There is a new trend that is all about telling novices that with just a few courses they can 'heal themselves'. I find
    that to be tremendously unhelpful and duplicitous and sets them up for disappointment. I, as a practitioner would
    never say I could heal anyone. I can only use my knowledge and skills to get them on the table and 'follow the energy'.

    And if any healing does take place, it is because of the commitment and faith that the client has within to do the
    exercises, the homework and take care of themselves in all areas of their life.
    So my emphasis here is not on reeling in a ton of new clients although that would be great
    if you want to <a routerLink="/book" target="new">book a session</a>. It is simply about
    sharing knowledge and helping in my small way, to provide enough tools for my readers to try it out for themselves.
    <br><br>
    Overcoming doubt, fear, cynicism - developing trust and faith - that energy is real and is affected by
    everything we do, think and feel - well that took a lot of years and a lot of faith. Faith in the work,
    faith in myself and faith that people in need will find me.

  <div class="text-dark">
    Change is generally suspect to the status quo way of doing business. Generally someone or something is threatened by change,
    losing their monopoly over something, usually to do with power or money. Revolutions are started by the brave, the courageous and they
    often don't live to see their victories. I hope that some day, not too long from now, people find their way back to
    seeing their bodies as their own sacred vessels. They can tend to them, speak to them,
    listen to them - cells all working together to form this miraculous thing called you. You are not just body parts
    that have no intelligence, that need to be cut out instead of listened to. Your body speaks to you, that is really all
    that I am saying and it isn't really that crazy of an idea if you just ask any Physicist as they are on the same path.
    <br><br>
    I am proud to be a practitioner of energy medicine. With every client and every session, finding myself continually amazed,
    that yes energy is not only real, but really is all there is. Our physical selves are always first created in the Etheric
    layer of our Aura, influenced by our moods, emotions, thoughts and actions. Tend to your Aura and create the you that you want.
    After practicing for a few years I became intrigued with another taboo area because I seem to be born to push the boundaries
    of what people are comfortable with. This time I discovered the world of <a routerLink="/aboutEndOfLifeDoula">
