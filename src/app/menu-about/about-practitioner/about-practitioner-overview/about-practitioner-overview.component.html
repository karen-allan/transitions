    <h2>Why this profession?</h2>

        I chose this profession for so many reasons. When I was at the bedside of my brother, instead of feeling any
        sense of calm or bravery, I felt overwhelmed and useless - even scared of his anger. I was horrified by his pain and felt
        utterly incapable of helping him. When I witnessed the indifference to my mother's care - the nurse assigned to her completely
        ignored her and acted annoyed by my mother's confusion and fear. When doctors would bristle at answering any of my questions related
        to her care.
        <br><br>
        It was the experience of missing out on meaningful closure when I lost people in my childhood. Of not being allowed to attend
        funerals. Of not being allowed to talk about the deceased in case it brought up too much pain. As if the pain wasn't already
        right under the surface.
        <br><br>
        It was the way other people reacted to our father's death. My sister and I were playing outside - needing to get away from all the
        grief that had just happened after losing our father. We heard a neighbor say "look at those kids, their father just died and
        they don't even care!" It was going into grade 3 and having the other kids either make light of it or go over the top with fake
        sympathy. I learned to keep his death a secret. He was not dead, he was a travelling salesman. Always out of town.
        <br><br>
        And on the positive side, being a strong advocate for my Mother, ensuring she died in a place that cared about her, with her
        dignity made me more proud of myself than anything else I have ever done.

        It was hearing so many nightmarish stories from my Energy Medicine clients about the pain and helplessness they felt when trying
        to support and make decisions for and about their loved ones.
        <br><br>
        I somehow stumbled upon the reality of Death Doulas, Death Midwives, End of Life Doulas and the whole Positive Death Movement
        that is sweeping the world. I felt like it was the anchor I needed to move my
        <a href="https://www.mindworksEnergyMedicine.com" target="_blank">energy medicine practice</a> beyond my treatment room
        and into the world where people need it most. Taking the college course was only the beginning of the vast amount of reading and
        studying that followed, as there is so much to know.
        <br><br>
        On taking the End of Life Doula course through Douglas College in Vancouver I learned about the many ways you can take
        back your power on behalf of yourself and/or your loved ones. In order to become certified, I took and passed the Criminal
        Records check.
        <br><br>
        It may not be for everyone, but for me there is nothing morbid about it. It is the opposite, it is about providing
        the dying and their families with the knowledge and support to maintain their dignity and independence right to the very end.
