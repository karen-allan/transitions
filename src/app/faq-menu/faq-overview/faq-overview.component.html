        When do you think that Energy Medicine will take it's place in the world of healing?

        We all know that we have blood and bones in our bodies, but unless we are medical
        professionals most of us don't know how
        our circulatory, respiratory, digestive or endocrine systems work. We just take it for
        granted that they do thanks to some smart person in the past who likely went against
        the established viewpoints and pursued her or his studies until they became accepted.
        <br><br>
        There have been many pioneers in the field of energy as well and as with anything
        new their findings have been met with skepticism. It always takes time for new paradigms to
        find validation and generally it is because of the pressure from patients who are looking
        beyond accepted, standard medical treatments and have found success with alternative therapies.
        <br><br>
        Luckily there are
        dedicated professionals who are gathering evidence based data from which the
        established medical community can now study.
