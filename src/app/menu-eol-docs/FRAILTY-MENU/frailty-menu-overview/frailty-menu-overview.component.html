                    Adults over 19 are encouraged to put a basic health care plan together in case of an accident or emergency.
                    This plan should include who you would like to make decisions for you should you be incapacitated in some way.
                    Generally if you are young and healthy you will want them to agree to any and all life saving treatments
                    and procedures in case you land in the hospital due to accident or injury.
                    <br><br>
                    This is something most of us never think of. But B.C. Law mandates that if you haven't got any kind of
                    document written that designates your primary and/or secondary representative/advocate, this choice will be made for you.
                    <br><br>
                     Let's say you are in a car accident and unable to speak for yourself. When you arrive at the hospital - a social worker
                    or other health professional will fill out a form called a Temporary Substitute Decision Maker. They are legally required
                    to follow in the order given on the form. The order is:

                    <ul class="dark-list">
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Spouse</li>
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Adult Children if any</li>
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Parents</li>
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Siblings</li>
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Grandparents</li>
                         <li class="list-item-no-image">Grandchildren</li>
                        <li class="list-item-no-image">Others Related by Birth or Adoption</li>
                        <li class="list-item-no-image">Close Friend(s) and Others related by marriage</li>
                    </ul>

                    If you have no issues with the idea that your health and life decisions are about to be made by someone selected by a
                    stranger, then this might work for you. If, however you know, for instance, that you want your oldest grand-child who is
                    over 19 to be the decision maker for you, but you have not written this wish down, it is highly unlikely
                    that they will work their way down the list to that level. Maybe instead, they will choose your spouse, the top person on the list to call.
                    But they may be an ex-spouse and may not have your best interests at heart. Your new girlfriend, who is your true love, will be
                    among those listed as the very last on the list.
                    <br><br>
                    It is for this reason, that it is smart and proactive to fill out a <b><a routerLink="/repSectionNineDoc">Representative Section 9</a></b>
                    form to legally and permanently state who you would prefer to make life and death decisions on your behalf.
                    <br><br>
                    By simply filling out this page, you can quickly and easily select the one or, at maximum two people you trust who would best
                    handle any health related decisions if you are not in a position to do so due to accident or injury. By filling out this list, you are letting
                    the health care team know who you have specifically chosen to make decisions for you related to your situation.
