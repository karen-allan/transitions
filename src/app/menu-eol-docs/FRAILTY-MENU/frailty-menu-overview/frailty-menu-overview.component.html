                All adults are encouraged to put a basic health care plan together in case of an accident or emergency.
                This plan should include who you would like to make decisions for you should you be incapacitated in some way.
                Generally if you are young and healthy you will want them to agree to any and all life saving treatments.
                <br><br>
                This is something most of us never think of. But in most provinces in Canada, if you haven't got any kind of
                document written that designates your primary and/or secondary Advocate, this choice for who will be
                contacted on your behalf will be made by a health care professional you have likely never met.
                <br><br>
                 Let's say you are in a car accident and unable to speak for yourself. When you arrive at the hospital - a health
                care team member is legally required to search for your next-of-kin and then fill out a list called
                many different names depending on the province you are in, but in general looks something like this
                one that B.C. uses (Temporary Substitute Decision Maker):

                <ul class="content-dark-list">
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Spouse</li>
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Adult Children if any</li>
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Parents</li>
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Siblings</li>
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Grandparents</li>
                     <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Grandchildren</li>
                    <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Others Related by Birth or Adoption</li>
                    <li class="list-item-no-left-pad">Close Friend(s) and Others related by marriage</li>
                </ul>

                If you have no issues with the idea that your health and life decisions are about to be made by a
                family member or friend selected by a stranger, then this might work for you. If, however you know,
                for  instance, that you want your oldest grand-child who is legally eligible to be the decision maker
                for you, but you have not written this wish down, it is highly unlikely that they will work their way
                down the list to that level. Maybe instead, they will choose your spouse, the top person on the list to call.
                This could be a soon-to-be-ex-spouse who may not have your best interests at heart. Your new
                girlfriend, who is your true love, may not even show up on the list.
                <br><br>
                It is for this reason, that it is smart and proactive to designate your own preferred Health Care Advocate who will, in most regions
                of Canada, be able to make those life and death decisions on your behalf. By simply stating your Advocate, you can quickly and
                easily select the one or, at maximum two people you trust who would best handle any health related decisions if you are not in a
                position to do so due to accident or injury. You are letting the health care team know who you have specifically chosen to make
                decisions for you related to your situation.

                No matter what your age, if you have any of the chronic health conditions you need to be more prepared for

                If you have these or any other serious, chronic condition it is very important to put a plan together for your family to
                follow. In addition to selecting the person or persons who will Advocate for you in the event of an emergency,
                you should also create an Advanced Care Plan. This allows you to add more information about the kinds of specific
                treatments and procedures that you may want to say yes or no to.
