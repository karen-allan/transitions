        "This form allows a Funeral Director to remove your body from a home without pronouncement of death. Pronouncement of death is
        not required by BC Law, although it is widely recognized that pronouncement is sound clinical and ethical practice for nurses and
        physicians."
        <br><br>
        "There may be circumstances when pronouncement is difficult or families choose to waive pronouncement.
        If a person dies in British Columbia, the death must be registered with the Vital Statistics Agency.
        A Medical Certificate of Death form is completed by the physician within 48 hours after a death.
        The medical certificate of death is forwarded to the funeral director who will register the death.
        The funeral director can then issue a death certificate and burial permit."
