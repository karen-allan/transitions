<div class = "content-dark-copy">
    By creating an Advanced Care Directive, you can state specifically which treatments and procedures you want
    your Representative to advocate for you. It provides another vehicle to letting them know what your wishes are.
    Your directive will be followed by the Health Care team as it relates directly to the situation at hand.
    <br><br>
    If your Advance Directive doesn't include a proposed health care treatment then the person appointed as your
    Formal Substitute Decision Maker will be asked to make the decisions.
    <br><br>
    This means for example, if you don’t want to be intubated and it says so in your Directive you will not be.
    If your Directive doesn’t mention being intubated then the decision will be made by your Representative.
    If you don’t have a Representative, the decision will be made by the Health Care team.
    <br><br>
    If you are concerned that your wishes may not be followed by your Representative, you will need to state in the
    Advance Directive that your Health Care providers may act in accordance with your instructions without the consent of your Representative.
    You can even name the procedures you would like attempted as well as the treatments you would not want.

    Life support and medical interventions include:

    <h2>Why Write an Advanced Directive?</h2>
</div>

<ul class = "content-dark-list">
    <li class="list-item">You want to be in charge of your own health, life and death</li>
    <li class="list-item">Your realize that doing so now could lead to less family conflicts later</li>
    <li class="list-item">You want consistency in who cares for you</li>
    <li class="list-item">You want to eliminate added stress for your family</li>
</ul>

<div class = "content-dark-copy">
    If you are the kind of person who would like anything and everything done in order to stay alive, you also need to
    put that in writing. You may want to know every detail about every thing they put in your body, you too need to put
    that in writing. Life never goes according to schedule and in emergencies and in life, mistakes happen, papers get mislaid
    and the requests you have written down may not be able to be followed.
    <br><br>
    Still the Advanced Directive can help you to really think about a future scenario. Do you want to know nothing, everything or
    somewhere in between? Would you want to be told if your doctors know that you will soon be facing death or would you
    rather hang on to not knowing? Would you accept any and all medications even if they make you too drowsy to communicate
    with your family. Or would you rather suffer some pain in order to still maintain some awareness and cognition. Would
    you be willing to try different types of alternative medical interventions? Or would you absolutely not want anything
    outside the medically approved box? And would you like to die in a hospital, a hospice, a care home or in your own home?
    <br><br>
    Are you the type of person who wants family all around you or do you find being alone or perhaps with just one other
    family member to be sufficient? If the latter is the case, should you consider writing down who you absolutely do NOT
    want at your bedside? Do you want to keep your diagnosis a secret or something only you and your spouse know about or
    would you want everyone to know so that they could offer their support? Perhaps you would want to name one family
    member to be your number 1 go-to person (besides your Reps) so that family bickering is kept to a minimum?
    <br><br>
    Perhaps you have never followed a religion but would still like religion to figure prominently in your death and funeral.
    Or on the opposite side, you may vehemently be opposed to having any kind of religious ceremony or funeral performed.
    Think about the setting - as mentioned above, but within whatever setting you end up in, do you want music,
    do you want grand-children in the room, do you want to be able to see the outdoors, are their smells that are
    offensive to you, what flowers do you loathe, are their any hospital staff who are upsetting you,
    what kind of physical touch do you like? Would you feel safe enough to talk about the visions
    you might be seeing - in other words you have a right to determine so many of these things that bring you comfort but
    you would be wise to write ... them ... down.

    We have made our own decisions throughout our life, what careers to follow, whether to have children, where to
    live etc. It makes complete sense that we should also be able to make detailed decisions about our death. The
    problem is that the subject can be upsetting for your or your family. Even if you want to discuss this, often
    times your family doesn’t want to go there with you.
    <br><br>
    However, without any kind of acknowledgement that we will all die some day and that it is wise to prepare for
    it ahead of time, we may fall victim to being ‘cared for’ that goes against of everything we believe in.
    Taking the time to write an Advanced Care Directive can save you and your family from the
    stress of having to make decisions that they might not even be aware that you are for or against.
    As long as you are capable of making your own health care decisions you will be the authority on your own behalf.
