        <h2>Decide who will advocate for you</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        Instead of leaving your health decisions up to B.C. Law, you can set who YOU
        want as your Substitute Decision Maker (SDM). Again, this is only if you are incapable of making your own
        decisions due to injury or illness. You can name your preferred SDM and even an alternate SDM by filling
        out a form called Representative Section-9. (This applies to B.C. only, check your province or state for
        a form that provides the same service).
        <br><br>
        Your Formal Substitute Decision Maker must follow the directives you have laid out in this
        Enhanced Representation Agreement should you become incapacitated. If you are only partially ‘incapable’
        you can still make some decisions and these will be given priority.
        <br><br>
        There is no need to involve a Lawyer, Doctor or Notary Public as Representative 9 is legal as long as proper
        witnesses and signatures are made.
        <br><br>
        Personal decisions include where you live (examples are a hospital, home care, hospice etc.), your diet, clothing and
        hygiene and activities. It also includes decisions about who can have contact with you.
        <br><br>
        Health care decisions include tests, examinations, treatments and procedures related to your health such as surgery, medication and vaccines.
        It also gives permission for the Representative to make decisions about life support and life prolonging procedures.
        It does NOT include decisions related to financial or legal decisions.
        If you are still of sound mind, you will always be the first to make your own decisions.
        However, if not, the health care provider will adhere to your fully legal Section-9 Representative document.
        <br><br>
        There are a number of forms created by different agencies including
        the Attorney General of B.C., the Dying with Dignity Association and Palliative Care B.C. They may vary wording slightly but
        they must all follow the legal guidelines. You can view and download the
        <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/managing-your-health/incapacity-planning/representation_agreement_s9.pdf" target="_blank">
        Representative Section-9</a> form here from the B.C. government website.
        <br><br>
        Before you start, you can go through each section as I have screen-shot below to fully understand your what the form is about. Ask your Representatives first
        and make sure they are willing to take on the task. Your witnesses do not need to be present during the signing with the Representatives, but
        they do need to see you sign the form.
