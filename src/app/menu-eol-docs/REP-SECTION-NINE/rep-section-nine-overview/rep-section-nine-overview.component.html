    <h2>Decide who will advocate for you</h2>
</div>

<div class="content-dark-copy">
    Instead of leaving your health decisions up to B.C. Law, you can set who YOU
    want as your Substitute Decision Maker (SDM). Again, this is only if you are incapable of making your own
    decisions due to injury or illness. You can name your preferred SDM and even an alternate SDM by filling
    out a form called Representative Section-9. (This applies to B.C. only, check your province or state for
    a form that provides the same service).
    <br><br>
    Your Formal Substitute Decision Maker must follow the directives you have laid out in this
    Enhanced Representation Agreement should you become incapacitated. If you are only partially ‘incapable’
    you can still make some decisions and these will be given priority.
    <br><br>
    There is no need to involve a Lawyer, Doctor or Notary Public as Representative 9 is legal as long as proper
    witnesses and signatures are made.
    <br><br>
    Personal decisions include where you live (examples are a hospital, home care, hospice etc.), your diet, clothing and
    hygiene and activities. It also includes decisions about who can have contact with you.
    <br><br>
    Health care decisions include tests, examinations, treatments and procedures related to your health such as surgery, medication and vaccines.
    It also gives permission for the Representative to make decisions about life support and life prolonging procedures.
    It does NOT include decisions related to financial or legal decisions.
    If you are still of sound mind, you will always be the first to make your own decisions.
    However, if not, the health care provider will adhere to your fully legal Section-9 Representative document.
    <br><br>
    There are a number of forms created by different agencies including
    the Attorney General of B.C., the Dying with Dignity Association and Palliative Care B.C. They may vary wording slightly but
    they must all follow the legal guidelines. You can view and download the
    <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/managing-your-health/incapacity-planning/representation_agreement_s9.pdf" target="_blank">
    Representative Section-9</a> form here from the B.C. government website.
    <br><br>
    Before you start, you can go through each section as I have screen-shot below to fully understand your what the form is about. Ask your Representatives first
    and make sure they are willing to take on the task. Your witnesses do not need to be present during the signing with the Representatives, but
    they do need to see you sign the form.

    Every province has different forms to help you achieve designating the advocates you want to have represent you.
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/cssd/files/seniors-pdf-ahcd-booklet.pdf">Newfoundland and Labrador</a></b> the form is called
    the Advance Health Care Directive form and within this form there is a section where you can designate your Advocate who instead of being called
    your Representative as in B.C., they are called your Substitute Decision Maker. Note the difference between this and the Temporary Substitute
    Decision Maker. It could all be so much easier if it was the same across the country!
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://novascotia.ca/just/pda/_docs/PersonalDirectiveLongForm0311.pdf">Nova Scotia</a></b>
    your Advocates are called Delegates and the
    Advanced Care form is called your Personal Directive. If you don't choose a Delegate,
    then the care provider will be authorized under the Personal Directives Act to use the called statutory decision-makers form.
    As with the Temporary Substitute Decision Makers form in B.C. this form will allow a health care provider to start at the top of the list
    and continue down it until they find someone who agrees to be your Delegate.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/health_care_directive_form.pdf">
    Prince Edward Island</a></b> the Health Advocate is called the Proxy and the Advanced Care Form you fill out is called a Health Care Directive.
    Unlike B.C., a Proxy need only be over 16, whereas in B.C. the 'Representative' must be over 19.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca/en/uploads/file/pdfs/Advance_Health_Care_Directives_Form_EN.pdf">New Brunswick</a></b>
    the Health Advocate is also called the Proxy and the form is also called the Health Care Directive. It also has a section
    where you can add those who you wish to have contacted. Only one witness is needed.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/issue-directives-case-incapacity">Quebec</a></b>
    the Advocate is called the Mandatary and the form is called the Advance Medical Directives. They will not allow you to view this
    form until you create a 'clicSÉQUR' account, after which a personalized form will be created for you.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://jss.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DWDC__2020Form_Ontario.pdf">Ontario</a></b> your Advocate is called the Substitute Decision Maker
    and the Advanced Care form is called the Advance Care Directive/Wishes form.
    It carries no legal weight, however, so anything that you have written down on this form in terms of your wishes may be disregarded by both your
    Substitute Decision Maker and by the medical team who will make decisions based on the situation at the current moment in time.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/documents/health_care_directive.pdf">Manitoba</a></b> your Advocate is called your Proxy and the form that you
    fil out is called the Heath Care Directive. There is no need to have
    anyone act as Witnesses with this simple to use form. They do not have any authority involving Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID).
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/sites/default/files/2021-05/Form-2021-02-26-AdvancedCarePlanningAppointingaProxy-v01_0.pdf">
    Saskatchewan</a></b> your Advocate is also called a Proxy and the form is called an Advance Directive. If you have not designated a Proxy,
    then the health care provider will appoint one based on the Temporary Substitute Decision Maker list.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://formsmgmt.gov.ab.ca/Public/OPG5521.xdp">Alberta</a></b> your Advocate is also called an Agent and the form is called an Personal
    Directive. This form provides for a wider range of
    duties that can be performed by the Agent as compared to other forms.
    <br><br>
    In <b>            <a target="_blank" href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/dwdcanada/pages/3905/attachments/original/1631639150/DWDC__2021Form_NorthwestTerritories_Fillable_092021.pdf?1631639150">
    the North West Territories (NWT)</a></b> your Advocate is called the Agent and the Advanced Care form is called the Personal Directive. It also
    includes areas to specifically request and/or reject certain emergency or life prolonging health care procedures.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://yukon.ca/sites/yukon.ca/files/hss/hss-forms/hss-careconsent-abbreviated-advance-directive.pdf">the Yukon</a></b>
    the Advocate is called the Proxy and the Advance Care form is called the Representative Agreement. This form also leaves
    room for you to add special directives related to your future care in terms of emergency or life prolonging procedures.
    <br><br>
    In <b><a target="_blank" href="https://yukon.ca/sites/yukon.ca/files/hss/hss-forms/hss-careconsent-abbreviated-advance-directive.pdf">Nunavut</a></b>
    legally there is no
    such thing as a stated Advocate and Advance Care Directives are not recognized. Anyone wishing to act as your
    Guardian must be willing to apply to the Nunavut Court of Justice for an order appointing them.

    This document should be kept with your will, and a copy should be given to the Representative you choose, the alternate if you choose,
    to have one. You can also leave a copy with your family doctor. Let your family, specifically your Representatives know where you have
    placed all your important documents. I personally have all of my documents, including the financial information in a fire-proof safe.
    Paramedics know to look for any kind of directive on or in your fridge or freezer.
