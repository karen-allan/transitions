        You can choose to receive CPR or be put on a ventilator if your heart or breathing stops.
        Being put on a ventilator is sometimes referred to as "being put on life support." CPR doesn't always work to
        resuscitate people, or "bring them back. And the older and sicker you are, the less likely it is to work.
        Here are some of the issues to consider:

        If you don't make your wishes known, your doctor and loved ones may face some tough decisions. In an emergency, you would probably receive CPR. Then you
        could be placed on life support, even if you didn't want it. Your doctor and family may have a hard time deciding how to continue your medical care.
        Also, it may be very hard for your loved ones to decide when to stop life support.
