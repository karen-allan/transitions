        If you have not planned ahead with any kind of personal health care directive such as a
        <b><a routerLink="/repSectionNineDoc">Representative
        Section-9 Agreement</a></b>, health care provider(s) must choose a Temporary Substitute Decision Maker for you. The order of
        the people on the list is set out in B.C. law and may not be changed. To qualify the chosen TSDM must be:

        <ul class = "dark-list">
            <li class="list-item-no-image">19 or over</li>
            <li class="list-item-no-image">have no dispute with you</li>
            <li class="list-item-no-image">have had contact with you within year of your needed treatment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="dark-copy">
        This means that you could be putting your health in the hands of a health care provider who has no knowledge
        of your wishes or beliefs and who must by law, choose the first person on the list who is qualified
        and available. This also means, if you have issues with anyone on this list, you could be at risk for not
        getting the real care you desire. You may, you may not, you just don't know. But when you fill out the
        <b><a routerLink="/repSectionNineDoc">Representation Section 9 agreement</a></b> you put your own care needs back into your own hands.
